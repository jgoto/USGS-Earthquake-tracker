# USGS-Earthquake-tracker

This Earthquake tracker is a simple web application that dynamically pulls the latest earthquake data from the US Geological Survey (usgs.gov) and displays information about the event to the page.

### Data Source: 
https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/significant_month.geojson

The Location, Time, Magnitude and a URL to the USGS with more information is displayed in 2 or 3 columns (depending on the screen width). The default search period is from the past month. However, there are also options on the folder-like tabs to search for earthquakes in the last day and the last week.
